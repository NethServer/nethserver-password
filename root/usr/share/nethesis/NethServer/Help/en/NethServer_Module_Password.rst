Password Policies
=================

Modify The Password Policies (the default policy is strong)

none
    there is no specific control over the password entered, but minimum length is 7 characters

strong
    The strong policy requires that the password must comply with the following rules:

    Minimum length of 7 characters
    Contain at least 1 number
    Contain at least 1 uppercase character
    Contain at least 1 lowercase character
    Contain at least 1 special character
    At least 5 different characters
    Must be not present in the dictionaries of common words
    Must be different from the username
    Can not have repetitions of patterns formed by 3 or more characters (for example the password As1.$ AS1. $ is invalid)

    Changing the default policies is highly discouraged. The use of weak passwords often lead to compromised servers by external attackers.
